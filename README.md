# Bayesian-Projects
This is where I'll be putting all my Bayesian statistics projects. 

All the notebooks should have the following:
1. Description of the task and project objectives
2. Brief overview of the data
3. Brief overview of the methodology
4. Conclusion and some recommendations

Here's a list of the project/s that are currently in this folder:
<ul><li> <i>Factors affecting math grades of Portugese students (Bayesian Linear regression) -- <b> Draft </li></ul>
